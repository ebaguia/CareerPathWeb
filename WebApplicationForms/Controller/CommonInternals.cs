Much of the work undertaken is of a world-class level, while in many areas, the research programmes, and academics and students involved, are clearly leading the world in their discoveries and developments.\n\nStudent life is vibrant within the faculty. The Engineering Atrium, which includes an oval-shaped 250-seat lecture theatre, four new computer laboratories and a café, is the hub for student activities. The atrium and its surroundings provide a relaxed environment for students that can be used for both study and socialising.\n\nOur illustrious alumni include former University of Oxford Vice-Chancellor, Dr John Hood, the most successful yachtsman in America's Cup history, Russell Coutts, and Chris Liddell, previously Chief Financial Officer of both Microsoft and General Motors.";
